### How to use

```kotlin
// Simple usage
val oneSecond = 1.second()
val tenSeconds = 10.seconds()

val twoDaysThreeHours = 2.days() + 3.hours()

val days = 3.days()
val hours = 6.hours()
val minutes = 12.minutes()
val seconds = 42.seconds()
val milliseconds = 2.milliseconds()
val nanoseconds = 99.nanoseconds()

// Also works with doubles (be careful about rounding errors)
val ninetyMinutes = 1.5.hours()

// It is just a shortcut to java.time.Duration
val threeHours = 3.hours()
val threeHours = Duration.ofHours(3)

// Singular and plural available
val minutes = 66.minutes()
val minute = 1.minute()
```
